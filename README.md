# SkyRizz E32

A Solana DIY Toolkit - Secure Element Enabled Development Board

## Overview

SkyRizz E32 is a development board designed for Solana blockchain applications with integrated secure element functionality. This repository contains the PCB design files and schematics for building your own hardware wallet or Solana-enabled IoT device.

## Features

- ESP32-based microcontroller
- Integrated Secure Element for cryptographic operations
- Designed for Solana blockchain interactions
- Open-source hardware design

## Hardware Files

All design files are located in the `PCB/` directory:

- **Schematic**: `SKYRIZZ-E3-Schematic.pdf`
- **PCB Design**: `PCB-design-alpha.pdf`
- **Prototype Photos**: 
  - `pcb-prototype-alpha-front.jpeg`
  - `pcb-prototype-alpha-back.jpeg`

## Getting Started

### For Hardware Builders

1. Review the schematic and PCB design files in the `PCB/` directory
2. Order PCBs from your preferred manufacturer using the design files
3. Source the required components from the Bill of Materials (BOM)
4. Assemble the board following standard PCB assembly practices

### For Developers

Firmware and software integration guides will be added in future updates.

## Project Status

This project is currently in **alpha** stage. The prototype has been fabricated and is undergoing testing.
